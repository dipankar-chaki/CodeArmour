# üéØ CodeArmour

CodeArmour is an AI-Driven application designed for vulnerability detection and explanation. This manual provides a comprehensive guide to setting up the development enviroment and running the CodeArmour extension. It inculdes steps for installing the necessary software, setting up a Python virtual enviroment, and compiling the project.


&nbsp;


# üîç Prerequisites
Ensure that you have the following software installed on your system:
- Node.js v22.3.0
- Python 3.12.4


&nbsp;


# üë£ Step-by-Step Installation Guide
1. Install `Node.js`

   If Node.js is not already installed on your system, follow these steps:

   1.1. Download and install `Node.js v22.3.0` from the [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org).

   1.2. It is recommanded to use `Node Version Manager` (NVM) to handle different Node.js versions and avoid potential npm install errors. Follow the instructions in the [NVM repository](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm).

2. Install Project Dependencies

   Navigate to the project directory `capstone-project-9900h16bhelloworld` and run the following command to install the required Node.js dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
   This will create a `node_modules` folder in the project directory.

3. Compile the Project

   To compile the project, run the following command in the `capstone-project-9900h16bhelloworld` directory:
   ```
   npm run watch
   ```

4. Install Python

   If `Python 3.12.4` is not already installed on your system, download and install it from the [Python official website](https://www.python.org).

5. Set Up a Python Virtual Environment

   5.1. Deactivate any activated virtual environments, such as `conda`, by running:
   ```
   conda deactivate
   ```
   5.2. Verify that you are using `Python 3.12.4` by running:
   ```
   python --version
   ```
   5.3. Navigate to the `resources` directory:
   ```
   cd resources
   ```
   5.4. Create a virtual enviroment named `.venv`:
   ```
   python -m venv .venv
   ```
   5.5. Activate the virtual environment:
   ```
   .venv\Scripts\activate.bat    # For Windows
   ```
   ```
   source .venv/bin/activate     # For macOS/Linux
   ```
   5.6. Install the required Python packages by running:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

6. Run the Extension

   6.1. Press `F5` (or `fn + F5` for macOS) in VS Code to open a new window with the CodeArmour extension loaded.

   6.2. Check the `DEBUG CONSOLE` in the terminal for process output.

   6.3. The models and CWE.zip files will be downloaded automatically, which might take a few minutes for the first time. Ensure the process is not interrupted.

   6.4. The git submodules will also be verified and updated automatically.

7. Verify Extenstion Features.

   After completing the previous steps, the CodeArmour extension features should be visible in the newly opened VS Code window.


By following these steps, you should be able to successfully install and run CodeArmour extension. If you encouter any issues, feel free to contact the development team for support üõ†Ô∏è.

# üëª Git Workflow for the Project 
### (DO THIS BEFORE EACH TIME YOU START WORKING‚ùóÔ∏è):

Before you start working make sure the branch you are working on is up to date with the remote master (DONT CODE ON YOUR LOCAL MAIN ‚ö†Ô∏è)

Step 1: Update your local main branch

```
git checkout main # Switches to your local main branch
git pull origin main # Pulls the remote main to your local main
```

Step 2: Make a new feature branch if you are starting a new diff. If you already have a branch for this diff, skip this step

```
git branch luke-interface-content # Makes a new local branch called luke-interface-content
```

Step 3: Switch to your feature branch

```
git checkout luke-interface-content
```

Step 4: Merge your local main (which should now be updated with our remote main) into your feature branch

```
git merge main
```

Step 5: Resolve conflicts if there are conflicts

Step 6: code your feature, then commit your changes to your local feature branch

```
git status # This is optional. It will show you the files you have changed
git add . # This adds all changed files to your staging area
git commit -m "your commit message" # This commits your changes to your local feature branch
```

Step 7: When your diff is complete, push your changes to remote feature branch

```
git push origin luke-interface-content # This pushes your changes in your feature branch to the remote feature branch
```

Step 8: go onto github and make a pull request. Make sure to put a good description in the diff so others can see what the diff is doing.
